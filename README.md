# xblock-review
This repository contains all of the code for the Review XBlock. The Review xBlock is designed to act as a review tool for learners in their edX course. The way it is implemented, the xBlock pulls from all problems a learner has previously loaded in the course and randomly selects 5 of them to reshow the learner. The idea behind reshowing problems the learner has seen is to simulate a review of the concepts the problems should be testing so in retrying the problem, they are reviewing their knowledge of the concept. These review problems contain a fresh state of the problem and are ungraded so learners are able to try them without fear of it harming their grade.
